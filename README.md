### 💡 About Me
I build software and data systems that are measurable and production-focused. Most recently, I automated competitive intelligence workflows at Wayfair and built Python backends at Zenith Services that improved efficiency and reduced downtime. My goal for Fall 2026 is a co-op where I can ship backend or data-heavy systems with clear business impact.
